# Magic 8 Ball

## Description

For my third project in the Flutter Udemy course, I was tasked with making a Magic 8 Ball. This project uses Flutter and Dart, and expanded upon my knowledge of the subject by introducing state to rebuild the application every time a function is called. I also learned about the Math package for Dart, and using the Random functionality to generate a random number upon a function call, in this case a button click.
